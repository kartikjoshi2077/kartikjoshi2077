# Passionate about Data & AI Innovation

Hi, I’m **Kartik Joshi**, a data strategist who turns complex problems into working products.  
My work sits at the crossroads of **machine learning, data architecture, deep learning, large-language models (LLMs) and practical business impact**. If it involves data, algorithms, and measurable results, I’m probably experimenting with it.

## What I Do

| Area | Quick Snapshot |
| --- | --- |
| **Cloud Engineering** | Production workloads on AWS, Azure and GCP (Vertex AI, S3, Glue, BigQuery, Colab Pro); rapid prototyping in GitHub Codespaces. |
| **Large-Language Models & NLP** | Fine-tune and deploy transformer stacks (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) for sentiment analysis, text classification and attention-based explainability; build LLM-powered decision-support tools and chatbot prototypes. |
| **Deep Neural Networks** | Design CNN and hybrid architectures with residual, squeeze-excite and attention blocks; recent work includes CIFAR-10/100 classification and a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) translator using webcam streams. |
| **Causal & Predictive Analytics** | Architected an  **11 % uplift, 2 % send-volume Next-Best-Action engine** for **ALDO Group** – a doubly-robust causal model that personalises email campaigns across millions of customers. |
| **Optimization & MLOps** | Gurobi portfolio optimisation, MLflow + Docker deployments, real-time Kafka → Spark streaming, Optuna hyper-parameter tuning. |

## 🏆 Selected Highlights

- **ALDO Capstone (Lead Strategist & Data Architect)**  
  - Designed a three-model NBA engine (uplift, response, and optimisation layers) that **boosted conversion by 11 % while reducing email traffic by 98 k/week**.  
  - Built causal uplift models with cross-validated doubly-robust estimators, SHAP explainability, and Optuna-tuned XGBoost.  
- **DistilBERT + SHAP Pipeline** – End-to-end 20 Newsgroups classifier with synonym augmentation, mixed-precision training, ONNX export, and TorchServe batch inference.  
- **Inventory Management System** – End-to-end Python + Notion solution digitising McGill Biobar inventory; automated order logging, GUI dashboard, and 100 % audit-trail accuracy.  
- **Flight-Delay Prediction** – XGBoost model with Optuna that improved baseline RMSE by 28 % on a 12 M-row dataset; integrated live data feed via Kafka to Spark for real-time inference.  
- **Hackathon & Case Wins** – Multiple podium finishes for data-driven retail, energy, and fintech challenges. Won **Best Use of AWS Tech** in **BSRM x ALDO GenAI Hackathon**
